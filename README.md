## Introduction

Wow, it's been a while since I've done something truly data sciency (predictions).

From a small competition I noticed on Kaggle a few days ago. It already closed by now, but I find this interesting for a number of reasons so I'll go ahead and work on it anyways. 

With no specific goal in mind (from the 'shareholders' POV) I'll go for generic accuracy.
